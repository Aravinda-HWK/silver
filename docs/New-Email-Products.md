# Interesting Email Products to Emerge Recently

(People working on silver should dog-food these)

## 1. Superhuman

Differentiator: Speed + UI

Moat: Cult-like productivity UX and performance optimizations.

Superhuman positions itself as the fastest email client ever built. It uses keyboard shortcuts, AI-assisted triage, and a minimalist UI to let power users fly through email. It’s optimized for Gmail, with features like undo send, follow-up reminders, and read receipts. It charges a premium (\$30/month), banking on user willingness to pay for speed and polish.

## 2. Hey

Differentiator: Opinionated workflows + privacy-first approach

Moat: Unique UX and philosophical stance on email.

Built by Basecamp, Hey reinvents email with radical concepts: the “Screener” (to approve senders), “The Feed” (for newsletters), and “Paper Trail” (for receipts). It blocks trackers and strips emails of spy pixels. You can’t use your own domain unless you upgrade. It's polarizing but has strong appeal for users fed up with traditional email.

## 3. Canary Mail

Differentiator: Security + AI

Moat: Built-in PGP encryption + cross-platform support.

Canary combines end-to-end encryption (PGP and SecureSend), AI writing assistance, and read tracking. It’s available on macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android, making it one of the few secure clients that work well cross-platform. It's great for users who want privacy without ditching usability.

## 4. Triage

Differentiator: Minimalism for mobile

Moat: Mobile-first “flick to archive” simplicity.
Triage simplifies email to a Tinder-like experience: swipe up to archive, down to keep. It’s designed for people who want to get through their inbox on the go without writing full replies. No bells, no whistles—just fast sorting.

## 5. Shortwave

Differentiator: Chat-like email + AI

Moat: Google pedigree + productivity-first UX.

Created by ex-Google engineers, Shortwave reimagines Gmail as a chat-style interface. It uses AI to summarize threads, suggest replies, and prioritize important conversations. It’s built on top of Gmail and supports team collaboration, making it a good middle ground between email and Slack.

## 6. Spike

Differentiator: Email-to-chat transformation

Moat: Unified workspace for messaging, tasks, and collaboration.

Spike turns traditional email threads into conversational chat bubbles. It also adds voice notes, video meetings, real-time collaboration, and tasks—all in one inbox. It’s trying to replace both email and internal chat tools like Slack for small teams.

## 7. Tempo

Differentiator: AI-powered founder tool

Moat: Focused feature set for startup leaders.

Tempo is built for founders and execs drowning in email. It offers AI-summarized threads, smart triage, and focus views. It aims to cut down cognitive overload by simplifying decision-making. Still invite-only, but growing steadily.

## 8. Polymail

Differentiator: Sales + team tools

Moat: Deep analytics and CRM-lite functionality.

Polymail brings sales-focused features like email tracking, templates, sequences, and team collaboration tools into the inbox. Think of it as Gmail + HubSpot lite. Strong fit for startups and sales teams.

## 9. Skiff Mail

Differentiator: End-to-end encryption + decentralization

Moat: Full suite of private tools (Drive, Docs, Mail).

Skiff Mail is part of the larger Skiff suite, which includes encrypted docs and storage. It competes with ProtonMail but offers a more modern UX and collaboration features. It’s open-source and targets privacy-conscious professionals.

## 10. Newton Mail (Rebooted)

Differentiator: Smart features in legacy UX

Moat: Cross-platform, stable, and familiar.

Newton was killed off, then revived by fan demand. It has features like recap (reminds you of dropped threads), send later, read receipts, and unified inbox across all platforms. It's not groundbreaking, but it’s one of the most polished traditional clients.
