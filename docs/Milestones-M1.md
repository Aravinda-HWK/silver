# Milestones

The first 3 product milestones of Silver will consist of building an "Email 1.0" product.  

Email 1.0 means the functionality of email products like GMail and OutLook, as of End-of-2024. This product will be the basis of building "Email 2.0", which will have next-evolution functionality.

This is (sort of) what Copper (previous incarnation of Silver) was supposed to be.
